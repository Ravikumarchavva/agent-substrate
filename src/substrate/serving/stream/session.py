"""AgentStreamSession — runs one agent turn and yields wire events.

This is the single place that orchestrates a streaming chat run:

  * registers the agent with the Runtime and submits the entry Message,
  * tails the run's EventLogProtocol, turning each entry into a WireEvent via
    ``protocol.wire_from_log`` (a log entry *is* a wire event — no mapping),
  * merges out-of-band HITL / task-board events from the thread's
    ``WebHITLBridge``,
  * watches for client disconnect and explicit cancel,
  * frames the run with ``protocol.hello`` … ``run.completed|failed|cancelled``.

The route stays thin: build the agent + message + bridge, construct a session,
and stream ``session.events()`` as SSE.  All the concurrency lives here.

There is no inline persistence here anymore: the agent itself durably logs
its own conversation (``ReActAgent``'s ``log_user_message``/journaled
``ctx.llm()``/``ctx.tool()`` calls) straight to the EventLogProtocol, the single
source of truth for conversation history (see
``serving/stream/history.py::project_thread()``). This session's only
remaining job is relaying that same log, live, to one SSE connection — a
disconnect (or this process restarting) loses nothing, since the run keeps
executing durably via its own Worker-owned Task regardless of whether
anything is tailing it, and a reconnecting client re-tails the log from
wherever it left off (``tail_wire_events``) or loads the finished
conversation from ``project_thread()``.

One subtlety survives the persistence removal: ``events()`` still must not
*cancel* its own tailing task (``agent_task``) on disconnect, even though
nothing downstream of it needs to keep running for persistence's sake
anymore. ``agent_task`` calls ``register()``+``submit()`` before it ever
reaches the tail loop — cancelling it at the wrong moment could abort the
run before it's even enqueued, which is a worse outcome than anything
persistence-related ever was. So a disconnect still detaches (rather than
cancels) an in-flight ``agent_task``, exactly as before; the only thing
that's gone is the reason it used to matter.
