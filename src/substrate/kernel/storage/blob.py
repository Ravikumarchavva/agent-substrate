"""BlobStore — general-purpose object/binary store contract.

Concrete implementations:
  Local / Standalone — Local filesystem blob store (WorkspaceFileStore in ./data/blobs/)
  Production / Cloud — S3-compatible object storage (SeaweedFS, MinIO, AWS S3)

``store`` writes bytes or text and returns an opaque ref string.
``resolve`` fetches the original bytes by ref.
``pin`` / ``unpin`` control TTL: pinned refs survive past the default
expiry window, which matters for long-running chains that must not find
their own intermediates expired mid-execution.
