    terminal-fail the run on the first attempt. Any other exception defaults
    to retryable — the framework can't safely assume an unclassified error is
    permanent, so it errs toward retrying (see ``RunRetryPolicy``).

    credentials, malformed tool arguments the LLM won't spontaneously

    Deliberately a ``BaseException``, not ``Exception``: agent and tool code
    routinely wraps journaled calls in broad ``except Exception`` blocks (to
    record a journal error and re-raise). If this were an ``Exception``, that
    kind of handler would silently swallow the suspend signal and journal it
    as a failed effect instead of letting it unwind to the Worker.

    ``wakeup`` (a ``kernel.runtime.wakeup.Wakeup``, referenced under
    ``TYPE_CHECKING`` to avoid a kernel/core -> kernel/runtime import cycle)
    is what the Worker passes to ``SchedulerProtocol.release(status=SUSPENDED,
    wake_on=wakeup)`` — it's how the raiser (``RunContext``) tells the
    catcher (``Worker``) what should wake this run back up.

    **Contract for any code that might catch this** (middleware, tool
    wrappers, task-group/cancellation-scope handling): a broad
    ``except BaseException`` — or an async framework's own cancellation
    trap — can still catch this even though ``except Exception`` cannot.
    Any such handler must re-raise::

        except SuspendInterrupt:
            raise  # never swallow — the run must actually reach the Worker

    Swallowing it here means the Worker never sees the suspend signal: the
