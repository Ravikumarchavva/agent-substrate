"""Multimodal PDF dataset ingestion — extract → chunk → embed → store.

Composes existing agent-substrate pieces without reimplementing any of them:
  - document-intelligence (PaddleOCR layout extraction) via ``ExtractionClient``
    (HTTP) — see runtimes/document_intelligence/client.py
  - ``StructureAwareChunker`` — markdown-heading-aware text chunking, see
    capabilities/knowledge/chunking.py
  - llama-embed/llama-rerank sidecars via ``EmbeddingReranker`` (HTTP) — text
    and image embedding into the same vector space, see
    runtimes/embedding_reranker/service/embedding.py
  - an optional ``blob_store`` (duck-typed ``upload``/``download``, e.g.
    ``S3FileStore`` — SeaweedFS/AWS S3, or any S3-compatible object store a deployment
    points it at, including a hosted one) for the source PDF and each
    extracted image, following the same pattern as
    ``backends/local.py``'s ``_store_image_bytes``/``_rehydrate_image``.

Distinct from ``RAGPipeline`` (pipeline.py): that one is text-only, driven
by the generic ``EmbeddingClient`` Protocol. This starts from raw PDF files
and produces multimodal (text + real image) ``Document`` objects via the
multimodal-specific ``EmbeddingReranker``.

Object storage is optional, not assumed: pass ``blob_store=None`` (the
default) to inline extracted images as ``ImageBlock(data=...)``, exactly as
a store-free deployment always has. Pass a blob store to instead write each
image's bytes there and keep only a small ``image_key`` reference in the
row's metadata — real, measured motivation: inlining serializes straight to
base64 in ``PgVectorStore``'s ``content_json`` JSONB column, and at
benchmark scale that's tens of thousands of multi-KB blobs bloating every
row. An upload failure degrades to inlining that one image rather than
losing it, matching ``backends/local.py``'s existing behavior.
