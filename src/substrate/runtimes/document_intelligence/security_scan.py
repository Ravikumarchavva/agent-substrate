"""Document structural/security scanner — thin wrapper over `doc-firewall`.

Runs on raw uploaded bytes, before PaddleOCR (or any parser) touches them —
a hostile file must not reach the parser first. Verified directly against
this deployment (not assumed from the package's own docs): a clean PDF
fixture scores `ALLOW`/0.0 risk in ~11ms; a synthetically constructed PDF
carrying an OpenAction JavaScript annotation scores `FLAG`/0.876 with four
concrete findings (`/JavaScript` and `/JS` tokens, JS-in-annotation-action,
active-content indicator) — real detection, not a stub.

Default install is pure regex/heuristic/format-specific checks — no ML
deps, matching this codebase's established no-torch-unless-necessary
philosophy (see `text_classifier.py`'s docstring for the parallel
reasoning). `doc-firewall`'s own optional `ml` extra (BERT/embeddings-based
detection, pulls torch+transformers) is deliberately NOT installed.
