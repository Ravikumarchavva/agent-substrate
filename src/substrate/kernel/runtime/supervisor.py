"""SupervisorProtocol — agents spawning, joining, and cancelling subagents.

This realizes supervision-v2 on the event-sourced substrate.

Relationship to kernel/supervision.py
--------------------------------------
``kernel/supervision.py::Supervision`` is the **policy** half: tree position
(run_id, parent_id, root_id, depth), budget (SpawnBudget), and retention
(HistoryRetention).  ``SupervisorProtocol`` (this file) is the **runtime** half: the
contract that actually creates and joins running entities.

``Supervision.spawn_child()`` mints the child's policy object.
``SupervisorProtocol.spawn()`` takes that policy and makes a real durable run out of it.

The four hard properties realized on the durable substrate
----------------------------------------------------------
1. **Replay-deterministic spawn.**
   ``spawn`` appends ``child.spawned{child_run}`` to the *parent's* log before
   enqueuing the child.  On parent replay the journaled entry returns the *same*
   ``child_run_id`` — never a duplicate child.  Same idempotency-key mechanism
   as a tool call: look up by (parent_run_id, step_seq, "child.spawn", child_agent).

2. **Mobile children.**
   A child is its own run with its own EventLogProtocol — any worker can pick it up.
   ``join`` is a suspend point: the parent suspends with
   ``Wakeup(kind="child_done", child_run=handle.run_id)``.  When the child
   reaches a terminal state, its worker calls ``SupervisorProtocol._complete`` which
   appends ``child.completed`` to the parent's log, stores the ``RunResult`` in
   ArtifactStore, and delivers a wakeup to the parent's SchedulerProtocol queue.

3. **Budget, not depth.**
   ``spawn`` consults a ``SpawnBudget`` bound to the root ``run_id``.  Over
   budget → ``BudgetExhaustedError`` (``kernel/core/errors.py`` — the same
   exception ``ExecutionTracker`` raises for token/cost/turn exhaustion; one
   exception type for "a budget of some kind ran out," not a spawn-specific
   one).  Per supervision-v2, ``max_agents`` / ``depth`` ceilings are
   dropped — the budget is the single constraint.  Enforced durably here
   (every ``SupervisorProtocol`` implementation), not only by the in-process
   ``SpawnTracker`` fast-path ``OrchestratorAgent`` uses.

4. **Cancellation cascade.**
   ``cancel(handle)`` durably marks ``handle``'s entire subtree (a recursive
   walk of the parent/child tree, not a wakeup message): live runs get
   ``cancel_requested`` set and observe it cooperatively at their next
   heartbeat (``ctx.check()`` then raises ``CancellationError``); suspended
   runs — with no live task left to ever heartbeat — are terminal-marked
   directly. Either way the at-most-once effect guarantee still holds; see
   ``Supervisor.cancel()`` for the concrete implementation.

Orphan handling on permanent parent failure
-------------------------------------------
See ``scalable-runtime-plan.md`` for the full policy.  Summary keyed on
``HistoryRetention`` of each child:

    RUN       → cascade-cancel  (a run-scoped worker is meaningless without parent)
    PERMANENT → detach, re-parent to root  (a durable citizen survives its creator)
    NONE      → cancel + compact log  (stateless worker, nothing to keep)

The disposition is logged in the parent's terminal entry as ``orphans_resolved``
so the decision is replayable and auditable.

    Semantic guarantees
    -------------------
    - ``spawn`` is idempotent with respect to the parent's log: replaying the
      same parent log entry returns the same ``RunHandle`` (no duplicate child).
    - ``join`` suspends the *caller* (logs ``run.suspended`` on the parent run)
      and resumes it when the child reaches a terminal state.
    - ``cancel`` cascades recursively to the entire subtree rooted at ``handle``.
    - ``children_of`` reflects the current state of the child registry; it is
      used for crash reconciliation (parent folds log, finds ``child.spawned``
      without ``child.completed``, and re-joins via this method).

        ``supervision`` is the child's policy — caller should produce it via
        ``parent_supervision.spawn_child(parent_agent_id)``.

        ``boot`` is the first message delivered to the child's inbox to start
        its ``run()`` coroutine. Its ``id``/``correlation_id`` are typically
        freshly generated by the caller on every call and are NOT safe to use
        for the spawn effect's identity — see ``path``.

        ``path`` is the caller's own replay-stable identity for *this*
        ``ctx.spawn()`` call site (``RunContext._alloc_path()`` — "the Nth
        journaled call in this run"), used to derive the spawn effect's id.
        Implementations must NOT derive that id from anything computed fresh
        each call (e.g. the current ``last_seq`` of the parent's log, or
        ``boot.id``) — both are non-deterministic across a replay precisely
        because spawning is itself what advances them, which would make the
        effect id drift on every attempt and defeat the idempotency
        guarantee below.

        ``correlation_id`` (also caller-derived, replay-stable) is stamped
        onto the delivered boot message and returned on the ``RunHandle`` as
        ``boot_correlation_id`` — this is what ``ctx.ask(handle, ...)`` waits
        on, so the child's reply is found without a second delivery.

        Raises ``BudgetExhaustedError`` (``kernel/core/errors.py``) when the
        root's ``SpawnBudget`` is exhausted.

        The spawn is journaled on the parent before the child is enqueued —
        on parent replay the same child_run_id is returned deterministically.
