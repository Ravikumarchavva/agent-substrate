"""Anthropic reasoning round-trip: a persisted ReasoningBlock must re-encode
into the exact wire shape Anthropic requires on continuation.

Anthropic extended thinking + tool use requires the prior assistant turn's
thinking block (with its opaque signature) be replayed verbatim, or the API
rejects the follow-up request. Before ReasoningBlock existed, reasoning was
streamed live and then discarded — this capability was absent by
construction. These tests lock in that the encoder now round-trips it.
