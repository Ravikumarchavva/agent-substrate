"""Conversation history — projected directly from the EventLog.

The EventLog is the single source of truth for a thread's conversation, not
a separately-written relational table. A thread's runs (in chronological
order — ``Scheduler.find_all_runs_for_thread()``) each contribute their
streaming wire events (``user.message``, ``text.delta``, ``tool.call``,
``tool.result``, ``input.requested`` — the same ``STREAMING_KINDS``
``wire_from_log`` maps for live streaming and reconnect) to one flat,
chronological event list. Live streaming (``AgentStreamSession``), reconnect
(``tail_wire_events``), and history (``project_thread``) are three views over
the exact same underlying data, through the exact same ``wire_from_log``
mapping — there is no second, independently-maintained store to drift from
the log.
