"""InMemorySupervisor — Stage 0 in-process implementation of SupervisorProtocol.

``spawn`` is lifecycle: creates a child run, records the spawn in
``_spawn_effects`` (so replay returns the same child_run_id), delivers the
boot message, and enqueues the child.  It does NOT wait.  Mirrors
``Supervisor``'s dedicated ``spawn_effects`` table — spawn
dedup is a SupervisorProtocol-local concern, not the generic effect Journal (which no
longer exists; ``ctx.llm()``/``ctx.tool()`` dedup through the EventLogProtocol itself
via ``EffectCache.fold()``).

``cancel`` cascades through the child's subtree by recursively cancelling
every child of the cancelled run, then marks the run CANCELLED.

``children_of`` is used by a restarting parent to reattach to in-flight
children after a crash (Stage 0: never needed, but the API is correct).
