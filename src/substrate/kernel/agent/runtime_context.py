"""CancellationToken (Protocol) and RunMeta — execution-scoped runtime metadata.

Both are threaded through every kernel API call so that:

- Any operation can be cancelled cooperatively (no global state).
- Distributed traces, deadlines, and tenant scoping are available
  everywhere without adding individual parameters to each call.

``CancellationToken`` here is a Protocol only — the concrete implementation
(real asyncio state: an ``Event``, a callback list) lives in
``agents/runtime/cancellation.py``, since kernel holds contracts, not
working implementations. ``RunMeta`` is a frozen value object; create one
per run() call — always with an already-constructed token from that layer,
never conjured here.
