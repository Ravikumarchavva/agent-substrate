"""RunContext — the L1 journaled execution context for durable agents.

This is what the agent author receives as ``ctx`` in ``agent.run(ctx, inbox)``.

Every capability method is journaled via the EffectCache + Effect system:
- On the **live path**: the real operation runs; the result is appended to
  the EventLogProtocol as an ``effect.result`` entry (durable) and cached in memory.
- On the **replay path**: the EffectCache (folded from the EventLogProtocol at lease
  time — see ``agents/runtime/effect_cache.py``) returns the cached result;
  the real operation is skipped entirely.

This gives the at-most-once guarantee: even if the worker crashes mid-run
and a new worker replays from the EventLogProtocol, effects that already completed
are never re-executed. Unlike a separately-TTL'd journal store, the EventLogProtocol
never silently expires an effect out from under a long-suspended run.

Suspension: SuspendInterrupt + replay-from-top
-----------------------------------------------
``ask``, ``sleep_until_signal``, ``sleep_until``, and ``join`` all suspend
the SAME way: consume (a non-blocking, at-most-once claim against the
SignalBusProtocol/deadline) fails to find what they're waiting for, so they raise
``SuspendInterrupt`` — a ``BaseException`` that unwinds straight past any
``except Exception`` handler in agent/tool code, out through the Worker.
The Worker catches it, calls ``SchedulerProtocol.release(status=SUSPENDED,
wake_on=...)``, and lets the Task end. Nothing is pickled or kept alive:
this is a genuinely dormant run (zero RAM, zero CPU) for both the in-memory
and Postgres backends alike.

Resume works identically for both backends: something fires a signal (or a
deadline/timer passes), the SchedulerProtocol flips the run back to ``pending``, any
worker leases it, folds a fresh ``EffectCache`` from the EventLogProtocol, and calls
``agent.run()`` again from the top. Every already-completed effect (LLM
calls, tool calls, prior signal consumes) is a cache/consume hit, so replay
fast-forwards silently back to the same wait point — which now succeeds
because the thing it was waiting for has arrived — and the agent's code
continues exactly where it left off, without ever knowing it was
suspended in between.

Capability surface (``ctx.llm()``, ``ctx.tool()``, messaging, spawn/join,
suspension primitives) is split across mixins as submodules of this package
(``journal.py``, ``messaging.py``, ``supervision.py``, ``llm.py``,
``tool.py``) — this ``__init__.py`` holds the ``Agent`` alias,
``RunContext.__init__``, and the properties that don't belong to any one
capability.

``Agent`` here is not its own Protocol — it's ``kernel.runtime.agent.Agent``
(generic over its context type) parametrized with the concrete
``RunContext``, so agent authors get IDE/type-check support for the full
journaled surface (``ctx.llm()``, ``ctx.tool()``, ``ctx.spawn()``, …)
without a second, hand-maintained Protocol declaration.

    Created fresh by the Worker for each agent.run() invocation.

    Effect identity uses a hierarchical path, not a flat counter — see
    ``_alloc_path``/``_enter_scope``/``_exit_scope`` (``context/journal.py``).
    This matters because a journal-hit call (e.g. a tool the run already
    executed before a crash) never runs its body again, so any journaled
    calls the body *would* have made (e.g. a suspending tool journaling its
    own ``ctx.uuid()``) are never re-issued on replay. A flat run-wide
    counter would desync from that point on — every subsequent effect_id in
    the run would miss the journal and re-execute (re-billing an LLM call,
    re-sending an email, ...). The hierarchical path avoids this: a
    cache-hit call consumes exactly one index in its *parent's* scope
    regardless of whether its body ran, and nested calls only ever exist
    within their own child scope, which is only entered when the body
    genuinely executes.
