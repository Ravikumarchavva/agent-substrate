"""SchedulerProtocol — work-queue, leasing, and admission control.

The SchedulerProtocol is the coordination layer between the durable stores (EventLogProtocol,
InboxProtocol) and the stateless Workers.  It knows *which* runs need attention and
*which* workers should handle them — but it never runs agent logic itself.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Accept enqueue requests (from InboxProtocol delivery, timer fires, signal fires,
  child completions).
- Issue leases to workers that poll for work.
- Track heartbeats and reclaim leases from dead workers.
- Enforce per-tenant fairness and backpressure.
- Coalesce multiple wakeup sources for the same run_id into one enqueue.

Coalescing guarantee
--------------------
If a timer fires AND a message arrives while a run is already in the pending
queue (or active), the SchedulerProtocol does NOT create a second queue entry.  It
merges the new wakeup trigger into the existing pending entry.  Workers receive
a run at most once per wake-cycle regardless of how many sources fired.

Dead-run retry policy
---------------------
When a worker releases a run with status=FAILED, the SchedulerProtocol consults
``RunRetryPolicy`` to decide whether to re-enqueue, move to dead-run, or
escalate.  The policy is passed at enqueue time and stored with the queue
entry.

Three-tier topology role
------------------------
SchedulerProtocol sits between Gateway (enqueues) and Workers (lease).  It is the
valve that prevents a viral agent from melting the cluster — per-tenant quotas
and backpressure live here, not in the Gateway or Workers.

    - ``enqueue`` for an already-pending run_id is a no-op (coalescing):

      worker dispatch.
    - ``lease`` returns at most ``capacity`` leases and never returns a
      run_id that is already leased to another worker.
    - A lease whose ``expires_at`` has passed is automatically reclaimed
      and the run re-enqueued without manual intervention.

      queue (and into dead-run storage if retries are exhausted).
