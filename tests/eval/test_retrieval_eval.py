"""End-to-end retrieval eval against a real Postgres + real embedding calls
(``OpenAIEmbeddingClient``, ``text-embedding-3-small`` — same as the app's
default ``EMBEDDING_MODEL``). Skips if Postgres isn't reachable or
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` isn't set — this is a real infra-dependent integration
test, not a unit test, same convention as ``tests/capabilities/test_pg_backends.py``.

Per the plan's §Evaluation harness / Verification point 5: **this is a
baseline measurement, not a target** — the point is confirming every
per-stage metric is computed and sane (0.0-1.0, hybrid recall generally at
or above whichever of dense/lexical alone found more), not hitting a score.
Numbers are printed via `-s` for a human to look at; assertions only check
shape/sanity so this doesn't become a flaky threshold test on a 12-query
starter set.

To grow this into the plan's real ~200-500 query target: replace
``dataset.build_starter_dataset()`` with a loader over a real labeled set
(ingest real documents — the Apple 10-Q used elsewhere this session is a
natural starting corpus — and hand-label relevant chunk ids per query), then
call ``run_retrieval_eval`` the same way. The runner itself doesn't change.
The image-category queries here use a chart/table caption as their
document text — the real image path (Qwen3-VL embeddings) additionally
needs the ``llama-embed`` sidecar (``docker compose --profile
embedding-reranker up``) and an ``image_store`` argument passed through the
same way; not covered by this file today.
