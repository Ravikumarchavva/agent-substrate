"""FollowGraph — the durable social follow-graph between agents.

Named ``FollowGraph`` (not ``SubscriptionGraph``) to avoid collision with
``kernel/storage/graph.py::GraphStore``, which is the RAG knowledge graph (entities,
relationships, Cypher) — a completely different concept.

What this is
------------
"Agent A follows agent B" means: whenever B emits on a topic, A's inbox
receives the message.  This is the Facebook/Twitter social model applied to
agents:

- An **information agent** (e.g. "trades-watcher") follows external sources
  and emits structured findings on its own topic.
- A **personal agent** follows several information agents it cares about.
- When the trades-watcher emits, fan-out delivers to every follower's InboxProtocol,
  waking each personal agent with the finding.

Relationship to existing primitives
------------------------------------
``Topic`` and ``Subscription`` (``kernel/messaging/message.py``) are reused as-is —
they are the identity and record types.  ``FollowGraph`` is the durable store
that keeps the graph alive across restarts and provides the fan-out query
(``followers_of``).  ``FanoutStrategy`` (``kernel/runtime/fanout.py``) uses
``FollowGraph`` to enumerate followers and deliver via ``InboxProtocol``.

    Semantic guarantees
    -------------------
    - ``follow`` is idempotent: following the same (follower, topic) pair
      twice returns a new ``Subscription`` but does not duplicate fan-out.
    - ``unfollow`` is safe to call on an already-removed subscription (no-op).
    - ``followers_of`` is consistent: it reflects all ``follow`` calls that
      completed before it was invoked.
