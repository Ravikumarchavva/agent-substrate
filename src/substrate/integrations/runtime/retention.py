"""Retention sweep — delete durable runtime state for old terminal runs.

Not wired into any automatic poll loop — call this from an ops cron job or a
one-off maintenance script. A run's full history (EventLogProtocol, spawn tree,
signals) has no automatic expiry otherwise, so left unswept these tables grow
without bound for the lifetime of the deployment.

Only ``run_queue`` rows with ``terminated_at`` older than the cutoff are
candidates — a row with ``terminated_at IS NULL`` is still live (pending,
running, or suspended) and is never touched, no matter how old
``enqueued_at`` is.

**Operational note:** conversation history is projected directly from the
EventLogProtocol (``serving/stream/history.py::project_thread()``) — there is no
separate, independently-retained chat-history table anymore. Sweeping a
thread's terminal runs deletes their EventLogProtocol entries, which means their
conversation history is gone too, not just runtime bookkeeping. If a
deployment ever wires this into an automatic cron job, size the retention
window with that in mind — it now doubles as the chat-history retention
policy.

    ``agent_id``, not ``run_id`` (one agent can have many runs over its
    lifetime, and its inbox is a shared queue across all of them, drained by
    whichever run is currently active), so there is no safe way to scope an
    inbox deletion to a single terminal run without risking a live message
    meant for that agent's next run.
