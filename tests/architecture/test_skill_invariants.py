"""Architecture invariants for the agent-skills system.

Mirrors ``test_kernel_invariants.py``'s approach: cheap, real checks that
catch what CI would otherwise silently pass. ``SkillLoader`` is intentionally
forgiving at runtime — a malformed or duplicate-named skill just gets logged
and dropped, so a typo in one skill's frontmatter never takes down the
server — but that same leniency means CI must check explicitly, or a broken
skill merges unnoticed and is only ever discovered by someone wondering why
it doesn't show up.

See ``docs/claude_docs/architecture/prompt-and-skills.md`` for why a skill's
own SKILL.md body has a line-count ceiling: past it, the model is re-reading
narrative that belongs in ``references/`` (read on demand) rather than in
the body every activation returns.
