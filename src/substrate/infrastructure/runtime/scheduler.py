        orphaned" bypass. Postgres alone cannot tell a genuinely-crashed
        worker apart from a live one whose lease simply hasn't expired yet:
        a live worker renews ``expires_at`` every ``_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL``
        (15s), comfortably inside the ``_LEASE_SECONDS`` (30s) TTL, so its
        row's lease is always in the future. Stealing a row on any weaker
        signal than expiry — e.g. "this is a fresh single-worker process, so
        nothing else can hold a lease" — was exactly what let a process
        restarted while a run was still finishing race the still-live old
        process: both ended up executing the same run and writing to the
        same EventLogProtocol, surfacing as ``ConcurrentAppendError`` (see
        git history for the incident this replaced).

        This makes recovery of a genuine crash (SIGKILL, OOM — no chance for
        the worker's own ``except CancelledError`` handler to release its
        lease) bounded by the lease TTL rather than instant. A *graceful*
        shutdown doesn't pay that cost at all: ``Worker.stop()`` cancels its
        in-flight tasks and awaits them, and cancellation there already
        calls ``release(..., status=CANCELLED)``, clearing the row before
        the process exits — so the common restart path finds nothing left
        to reclaim here in the first place.

        Requeued runs become ``pending``; when their agent is (re-)registered
        the worker leases them and the kernel replays from the EventLogProtocol
        (the journal makes completed effects at-most-once). Returns the count.
