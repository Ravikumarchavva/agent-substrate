"""InMemorySignalBus — Stage 0 in-process implementation of SignalBusProtocol.

Consume-based, matching the durable (Postgres) backend's semantics exactly:
``signal()`` buffers a payload and wakes the target run via the SchedulerProtocol if
it's suspended and waiting on that name; ``consume()`` claims one buffered
payload, exactly-once per ``effect_id`` (idempotent re-claim on replay).
There is no blocking wait here — suspension is achieved by the caller
raising ``SuspendInterrupt`` when ``consume()`` returns ``None``, not by
parking a coroutine on this bus. That's what makes a SUSPENDED run genuinely
zero-cost: no asyncio Task, no Event, nothing — the Worker's Task has
already ended by the time this bus is holding a buffered-but-unclaimed
signal.
