"""Wire events — the single source of truth for the engine→UI SSE protocol.

Every event the engine streams to the UI is one of the Pydantic models below.
They form a discriminated union on the ``type`` field (``WireEvent``). The UI's
TypeScript types are generated from this module's JSON Schema, so the two sides
cannot drift.

Conventions (enforced here, relied on by the UI):
  * ``type`` is a dotted, namespaced string: ``<domain>.<event>``.
  * All fields are snake_case.
  * Every event is JSON-serializable with ``model_dump(mode="json")``.

A note on layering: these are *wire* types. Their ``type`` discriminator and
fields are deliberately identical to the kernel run-log ``kind``/``payload`` for
streaming events, so ``protocol/from_log.py`` builds them by plain validation
(``{"type": kind} | payload``) rather than a hand-written translation table.
