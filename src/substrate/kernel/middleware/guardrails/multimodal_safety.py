"""Multimodal input safety guardrail — TURN stage, group-evaluated.

Evaluates every content block of the turn's *last* message together: each
``TextBlock`` (normalized first) through a ``TextSafetyClassifier``, each
``ImageBlock`` with directly-available bytes through an
``ImageSafetyClassifier``. The turn's verdict is the max severity across
every block and every detector — "in group," per the design: a benign text
caption next to a flagged image still flags the whole turn.

A cheap regex layer (the existing, previously-unused ``_INJECTION_PATTERNS``
from ``prompt_injection.py``) runs *before* the model on each text block —
free, and catches blatant known phrasings a semantic classifier can
genuinely miss. Concretely verified during this implementation: Prompt
Guard scored "developer mode... do anything now" at only 0.3% malicious —
a near-miss on a very well-known jailbreak template — while the regex
pattern for exactly that phrase already existed in this codebase, unused.
Defense in depth, not redundancy.

Persist-but-exclude: by the time this middleware runs, ``ReActAgent.
_handle_message()`` has already durably logged the user's message
(``log_user_message`` runs before the middleware pipeline — see
``agents/core/react.py``) — so "persists in thread history" is already true
for free. This middleware's job is only the other two-thirds: (1) journal a
companion ``user.message.flagged`` marker referencing that exact message's
seq, for admin visibility and for ``agents/factory.py::step_rows_from_log``
to redact it from future turns' context, and (2) halt the turn via
``MiddlewareTermination`` *before* the LLM is ever called — the model never
sees the flagged content on this turn, no LLM spend, no exception to that.

Known, named gap (not silently dropped): ``ImageBlock`` can reference
``url``/``file_id`` without inline ``data`` — this guardrail only classifies
blocks with directly-available bytes. OCR-on-chat-images (catching T4,
cross-modal injection rendered as pixels, on the *live chat* path — the
document-upload path's own OCR cascade is separate and unaffected) requires
an async call to the extraction service and is deliberately not built in
this pass; a block this guardrail can't evaluate is treated as unable-to-
verify, not as flagged (fail-open on a genuine capability gap, not a
security bypass of something we could check).
