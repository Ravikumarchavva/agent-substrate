"""KnowledgeSearchTool — semantic search over a real knowledge base.

Thin wrapper around a ``RagBackend`` (``capabilities/knowledge/backends/``) —
all ingestion/retrieval logic lives there (local pgvector pipeline, or a
managed service like Pinecone Assistant). This tool only adapts the agent
tool-call shape to ``backend.ingest``/``backend.query``, and labels each
retrieved passage with a stable citation number (``capabilities/knowledge/
citations.py``) so the model can cite ``[n]`` and the UI can render a
clickable, grounded source for it.
