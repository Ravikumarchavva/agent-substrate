    Session / run relationship:

      History is always primarily keyed by ``session_id``.
    - ``run_id`` — one execution tree (short-lived; one run() call).

      touching other runs in the same session — enabling ``HistoryRetention.RUN``
      without destroying cross-run context.

    Does not summarise or compact — that is ``CompactionStrategy``'s job.
