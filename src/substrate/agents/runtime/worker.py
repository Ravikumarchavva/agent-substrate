"""Worker — the run loop that leases runs and calls Agent.run().

Each leased run is executed as an asyncio Task, but the Task does NOT stay
alive across a suspension. When the agent awaits something not yet available
(``ctx.ask()``, ``ctx.sleep_until_signal()``, ``ctx.sleep_until()``,
``ctx.join()``), ``RunContext`` raises ``SuspendInterrupt`` — a
``BaseException`` that unwinds straight out of ``agent.run()`` to
``_run_agent`` below. This Task then genuinely ends: the run is released
with ``status=SUSPENDED`` and costs nothing until something wakes it. Resume
is just a fresh lease: any worker (this one or another) picks it up, folds a
new ``EffectCache`` from the EventLogProtocol, and calls ``agent.run()`` again from
the top — every already-completed effect and consumed signal replays as a
cache hit, so execution fast-forwards silently back to the same wait point,
which now succeeds. See ``agents/runtime/context.py`` module docstring for
the full suspend/resume contract.

Multiple agents can be in-flight concurrently because each is its own Task.
The SchedulerProtocol's lease capacity controls how many are started per poll tick.
