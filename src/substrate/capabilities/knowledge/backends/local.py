"""LocalRagBackend — a thin façade over the existing, working local pipeline.

Reuses, unchanged:
  * ``ExtractionClient`` → the document-intelligence service when
    ``extraction_service_url`` is configured (layout-aware: chart/table
    detection, OCR) — the same call
    ``routes/chat_context.py::_extract_document_text`` makes for chat
    attachments, so parsing behavior is identical between the two paths.
  * ``EmbeddingRerankerClient`` → the embedding-reranker service when
    ``embedding_reranker_service_url`` is configured (multimodal embedding,
    reranking) — a separate service from extraction, see
    runtimes/embedding_reranker/.
  * ``PDFLoader``/``TextLoader``/``CSVLoader``/``JSONLoader`` — the local,
    no-service fallback (PDF/text/csv/json only; DOCX/PPTX have no
    extraction path at all — the extraction service doesn't parse them
    either, same limitation chat attachments already have).
  * ``RAGPipeline`` — chunk → embed → store (text only).
  * ``LLMReranker``/``CrossEncoderReranker`` — optional post-query reordering.

Chart/table images extracted by the service bypass ``RAGPipeline`` entirely
(it always re-embeds via the text embedding client, ignoring any pre-set
``Document.embedding`` — see ``pipeline.py::ingest_documents``) and go
through a separate multimodal ingest path into ``image_store``, a second
``VectorStore`` with its own embedding dimensionality (Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B:
2048, see docs/claude_docs/decisions.md) that can't share a table with the
text store's dimensionality. At query time, though, its candidates are
merged with the text store's into one pool before reranking — see
``query()``/``_hybrid_candidates()`` below — not kept in a separate path.
