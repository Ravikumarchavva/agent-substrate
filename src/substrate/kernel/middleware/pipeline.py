    Every middleware in the pipeline implements the identical
    ``Middleware.process(context, call_next)`` shape — there is no
    per-stage pipeline variant. A middleware that only cares about one
    stage (or a few) declares that via a class-level ``stages`` attribute
    (a ``frozenset[MiddlewareStage]``); this pipeline skips calling
    ``process()`` for any stage a middleware didn't declare, so a
    TOOL-only middleware never runs — not even a no-op pass-through —
    during a TURN or CHAT dispatch. A middleware that omits ``stages``
    entirely runs at every stage.
