"""SpawnTracker — run-level headcount authority with priority-based preemption.

``Supervision`` (kernel) carries the policy numbers (max_agents, priority).
``SpawnTracker`` (agents layer) carries the mutable state that enforces them.

Two orthogonal mechanisms:

headcount  — ``max_agents`` is a shared pool for the whole run. Every agent
             that is spawned consumes one slot; ``release()`` returns it so
             temporary agents don't permanently exhaust the quota.

priority   — When the pool is full, HIGH/CRITICAL agents can preempt
             lower-priority active agents by issuing them a cooperative pause
             signal (``_paused``), reallocating the slot to the higher-priority
             requester without waiting for the victim to finish. ``is_paused()``
             is available for a caller to check and stop spawning further work
             on the victim's behalf — no agent loop in this codebase consults
             it automatically today, so the practical effect of a pause is
             currently limited to slot reallocation, not the victim actually
             stopping early.

Usage::

    supervision = Supervision.root(orchestrator_id, spawn_budget=SpawnBudget(max_agents=20))
    budget = SpawnTracker(supervision)

    # Before each spawn_child() call:
    budget.acquire(agent_id, priority=Priority.HIGH)   # raises on limit breach

    # When an agent's run is complete:
    budget.release(agent_id)

    # Dynamic reprioritization mid-run:
    budget.reprioritize(agent_id, Priority.LOW)
