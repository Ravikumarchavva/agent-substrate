"""FanoutStrategy — how an emitted message reaches all followers.

The strategy pattern keeps the delivery mechanism swappable without touching
the kernel contracts.  Stage 0 uses a simple push-to-all; Stage 3 adds the
celebrity-agent pull hybrid so a viral agent with 1M followers does not
trigger 1M synchronous inbox writes.

Fan-out is always initiated by a call to ``FanoutStrategy.publish`` — never
by the agent directly.  The agent calls ``ctx.emit(topic, msg)``; RunContext
(L1) looks up the FanoutStrategy from the runtime and delegates.

Stage 0 — push fan-out (simple, works for normal agents)
---------------------------------------------------------
For each follower of ``topic``:  ``InboxProtocol.deliver(follower, msg)``
One synchronous inbox write per follower.  Fine at small scale.

Stage 3 — push/pull hybrid (celebrity agents)
----------------------------------------------
Agents with > N followers (configurable threshold) switch to pull:
- One write to a shared "latest post" store.
- Followers pull lazily when they next wake (for their own reasons).
- Avoids a synchronous write storm on a viral emit.
The threshold and pull store are implementation concerns, not kernel concerns.
