"""HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) approval contract.

When a tool carries ``ToolRisk.HIGH`` or ``ToolRisk.CRITICAL``, the agent
may pause and request human approval before executing.  These types define
the contract between the agent loop and any approval backend (web UI,
Slack bot, CLI prompt, or automated policy engine).

``ApprovalRequest`` is immutable and fully serializable so it can be stored,
forwarded over pub/sub, and resumed after a restart.
``ApprovalDecision`` is the typed response; ``MODIFIED`` carries edited
arguments via ``ApprovalResult.modified_args`` rather than a separate
request/response vocabulary — this is the single approval contract for the
framework (see ``serving/monolith/sse/approval.py::SSEApprovalHandler`` for
the concrete web implementation).
``ApprovalHandler`` is the protocol any backend must implement.
