"""SignalBus — Stage 1 durable implementation of SignalBusProtocol, backed by asyncpg.

Buffered, exactly-once-per-effect_id semantics — see the kernel ``SignalBusProtocol``
Protocol docstring for the guarantees. Coupled with ``Scheduler`` by
design: ``signal()`` wakes a matching suspended run in the same transaction
as the buffer insert (``run_queue.wake_signals``), and
``Scheduler.release(SUSPENDED)`` double-checks this table for an
already-arrived signal before actually parking — both sides of the
lost-wakeup race are closed by sharing one database, one transaction each.
