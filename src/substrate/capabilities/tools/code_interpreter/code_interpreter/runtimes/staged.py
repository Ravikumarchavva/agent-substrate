"""StagedSandboxRuntime — run a sandbox against a store that has no filesystem.

Every local runtime (bubblewrap, inprocess) executes with ``cwd`` inside a real
directory tree, and the k8s runtime mounts one. Object storage offers ``GET``/
``PUT`` on keys, not ``open()``/``write()``/``seek()``, so when
``FILE_STORE_BACKEND=s3`` there is no tree for them to run in.

This wrapper closes that gap by *materialising* the session before a run and
uploading what the run changed afterwards — the store stays the single source of
truth, while the sandbox still gets full POSIX semantics on a local scratch
tree. The alternative, FUSE-mounting the bucket (s3fs, mountpoint-s3), was
rejected deliberately: those clients have no random writes, no rename and no
append, so ordinary things like editing a file in place or ``pip install``ing
into the workspace fail in ways that are hard to explain to a user.

Scratch is disposable by construction: anything the run needs is pulled from the
store, and anything worth keeping is pushed back. That makes it safe for the
local tree to be a container's ephemeral disk.
