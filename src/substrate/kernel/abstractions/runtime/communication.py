"""Communication value types for the durable ask/send/reply model.

``AskOutcome`` is the discriminated result of ``RunContext.ask()``.
The four ``kind`` values are mutually exclusive and must NOT be collapsed:

    replied         — target finished and sent a reply within the timeout
    timed_out       — caller's patience expired; target is still RUNNING (lease alive)
    target_failed   — target's lease expired (worker died); safe to retry
    target_cancelled — target was explicitly cancelled (by the caller or a parent)

Collapsing ``timed_out`` with ``target_failed`` is the canonical bug that
spawns a duplicate agent while the original is still running.

``RunStatusSummary`` is the compact snapshot returned by ``RunContext.status(handle)``.
It is a batched peek — NOT a stream. The parent agent calls it rarely and only
when it has a reason (e.g., LLM tool call, supervision rule).  The human/UI
watches live progress through the SSE path (``EventLogProtocol.tail``), which is
entirely separate and never touches the parent agent's context.
