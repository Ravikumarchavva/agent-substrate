"""Cancel endpoint — aborts a running agent stream for a given thread.

POST /chat/{thread_id}/cancel
  Resolves the thread's active run_id durably (``SchedulerProtocol.find_run_for_thread``
  — a DB query, not an in-process registry) and cancels it via
  ``SupervisorProtocol.cancel()``. This works regardless of which replica is actually
  running the stream: the cancel is observed either almost-instantly (if this
  request happens to land on the same replica, via the best-effort
  ``Runtime.cancel()`` fast path) or within one heartbeat interval (via the
  durable ``cancel_requested`` column — see ``Scheduler.heartbeat``),
  and the streaming replica notices via the EventLogProtocol's ``run.cancelled``
  entry either way (see ``AgentStreamSession._check_disconnect``'s docstring).
