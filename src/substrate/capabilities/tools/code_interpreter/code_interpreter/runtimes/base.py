"""SandboxRuntime — the contract every code-execution backend implements.

The seam that decouples *what* the agent asks for (run this code, in this
session's directory) from *how* it is isolated (nsjail namespaces on a
single host, a gVisor pod in Kubernetes, or nothing at all in tests). Adding a
Firecracker/Kata/Docker backend later means adding one module here — no agent,
tool, or serving code changes.

Isolation is the runtime's job, not the caller's. ``SandboxSpec`` states the
*intent* (this user, this session, this directory, these limits, this network
policy); each runtime enforces it with whatever primitive it has.
