"""Thin async HTTP client for the llama-embed / llama-rerank sidecars.

Both are real ``llama-server`` processes (see ``deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml``)
serving Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B (``--embedding --pooling last``, ``POST
/embeddings``) and Qwen3-VL-Reranker-2B (``--reranking``, ``POST /rerank``)
respectively — replacing the previous in-process SentenceTransformer/
CrossEncoder models. Request/response shapes for text embedding, image
embedding, and rerank were all verified via real calls against the running
sidecars (not assumed from docs) — see ``docs/claude_docs/decisions.md``.
Two real bugs were caught this way and fixed: ``/embeddings``' response
nests one level deeper than expected (``embedding`` is a list of
per-sequence vectors, not a flat vector), and the OpenAI-compatible
chat-completions image_url shape does not work against this server's
``/embeddings`` at all — the real accepted shape is
``{"prompt_string": ..., "multimodal_data": [base64, ...]}``, found by
reading llama.cpp's own source.
