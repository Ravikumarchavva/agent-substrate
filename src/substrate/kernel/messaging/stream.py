"""User-facing visibility stream — progress events emitted by agents.

Two independent event channels:

1. **Token stream** (``TextDelta``, ``ReasoningDelta``, ``CompletionEvent``,
   ``StreamDone``) — LLM token-by-token output from the agent currently
   speaking to the user.

2. **Progress stream** (``AgentProgress``) — structured step events emitted
   by every agent in the supervision tree throughout execution. All agents in
   one run publish to ``Topic("agent.progress", run_id)`` — a single topic
   shared across the whole tree. The UI subscribes once to that topic and
   reconstructs the hierarchy from ``agent_id``, ``parent_id``, and ``depth``.

Standard topic convention (enforced by the agents layer, not the kernel):

    token stream  → Topic("agent.stream/<run_id>")
    progress      → Topic("agent.progress", run_id)        ← ONE per run

These are pure data types. Transport (SSE, WebSocket, console) lives in the
serving layer.

Sequencing:
    Every event carries a ``seq`` counter that is strictly increasing within
    one run. Over pub/sub transports that may reorder delivery, consumers use
    ``seq`` to reassemble events in emission order.  ``agent_id`` and ``run_id``
    on every event allow demultiplexing concurrent multi-agent streams from a
    single subscription.
