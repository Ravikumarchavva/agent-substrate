"""05_safety/02_evals.py — LLM-as-judge evaluation and structured output validation.

Demonstrates:
  1. parse()    — extract typed structured data from free-form text (no agent needed)
  2. LLMJudge  — score a single agent response using an LLM judge guardrail
  3. Eval loop — batch scoring of Q&A pairs, compute average quality score
  4. Schema mismatch — what happens when the model output doesn't fit the schema

# Infrastructure: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable must be set.
