    Splits text into sections on markdown headings (``#`` .. ``######``, adapted

    approach). Text with no detected headings falls back to a single section
    covering the whole input. Within each section, sentences are packed
    greedily up to ``chunk_size`` characters with ``overlap`` characters
    carried over between consecutive chunks.

    Sentence boundaries come from an injected ``segmenter``
    (:class:`~substrate.capabilities.knowledge.segmentation.SentenceSegmenter`),
    defaulting to the punctuation regex this class has always used. Pass
    ``SaTSegmenter()`` for text where terminal punctuation is unreliable —
    OCR'd PDFs, headings, and list items in particular.

    Protected spans: callers may pass ``protected_spans`` to :meth:`chunk` —
    a list of ``(start_offset, end_offset)`` character offsets into the
    *original* ``text`` (e.g. detected table/image-caption blocks) that must
    never be split. Any such span is emitted verbatim as its own chunk,
    regardless of ``chunk_size``, and sentence packing resumes around it.

    Every returned ``Document`` carries three extra metadata fields set in
    document order across the whole input: ``prev_chunk_id`` / ``next_chunk_id``
    (neighbouring chunk ids, ``None`` at the ends) and ``section_id`` (an
    incrementing int shared by every chunk produced from the same detected
