        Two call shapes, handled differently:

        - ``target`` is a ``RunHandle`` from a PRIOR ``ctx.spawn()``: the
          child is already running, already booted with a message. This call
          only WAITS, using ``handle.boot_correlation_id`` — it does not
          send anything. (Re-sending ``msg`` here — even a copy — would
          collide with the InboxProtocol's idempotent-by-message-id dedup the moment
          the caller reuses the same ``Message`` object for both the
          ``spawn(boot=msg)`` and this call, a natural and common pattern:
          whichever delivery lands second is silently dropped, and if it's
          this one, the correlation_id this wait listens on is never the one
          the child actually replies with.)
        - ``target`` is a plain ``Actor``: this call both sends and waits.
          The correlation_id is derived from this call's own replay-stable
          path, NOT taken from ``msg.correlation_id`` (unless
          ``idempotency_key`` is given explicitly) — a caller that builds a
          fresh ``Message`` with an auto-generated correlation_id on every
          call to its own ``run()`` would otherwise get a DIFFERENT id on
          every replay attempt, silently defeating both the at-most-once
          send guarantee and the ability to ever find a reply buffered under
          a previous attempt's id.

        The target calls ``ctx.reply(msg, result)`` to complete the ask.  If
        ``target`` is a ``RunHandle``, a supervisor that fires
        ``child:{run_id}`` signals on completion (see
        ``Supervisor``/``InMemorySupervisor``) makes a
        crashed/cancelled child resolve immediately instead of only after
        the full timeout — this wait watches both names at once.
