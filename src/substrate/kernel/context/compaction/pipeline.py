"""CompactionPipeline — chains multiple CompactionStrategies in sequence.

Each strategy's output is fed as input to the next.  This lets you compose
lightweight strategies without writing a custom class::

        ToolResultCompactionStrategy(),

When only one strategy is needed, pass it directly — no need to wrap it.
