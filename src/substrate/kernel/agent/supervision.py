"""Supervision hierarchy — agent execution policy and tree position.

Supervision types live here rather than in ``identity`` because they model
execution policy, not routing identity.  ``Actor`` and ``Topic``
(in ``identity.py``) are pure routing keys; ``Supervision``, ``Priority``,
and ``HistoryRetention`` are policy metadata that flows down the agent tree.

Budget model (supervision v2)
------------------------------
Two orthogonal frozen configs are embedded in every ``Supervision`` node:

``SpawnBudget``
    Run-wide cap on the total number of agents that may be spawned.
    Shared across the entire tree — the same object is propagated to every
    child via ``spawn_child()``.  The L1 ``SpawnTracker`` (agents layer)
    carries the mutable state (current count, paused set) that enforces it.

``ExecutionBudget``
    Per-agent resource limits: tokens, cost, turns, wall-clock time.
    Each child inherits the parent's policy by default; ``spawn_child()``
    accepts an override so a sub-agent can be given a tighter budget.
    The L1 ``ExecutionTracker`` (agents layer) tracks consumption against it.
