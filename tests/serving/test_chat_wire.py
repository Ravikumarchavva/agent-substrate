"""build_user_blocks — the message content the agent actually receives must
include attached images, not just text.

Regression test for a real bug: chat.py used to compute an image-carrying
`user_input_content` list that nothing ever read, so an uploaded image was
never attached to the user turn even though a vision model was correctly
resolved for the request — the model always saw text-only content."""
