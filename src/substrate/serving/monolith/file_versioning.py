"""Workspace file versioning — one snapshot lineage shared by both writers.

A workspace file (e.g. a code-interpreter-generated report) can change two
ways: the human edits it in the side panel (author="user", via the PUT
save-back) or the agent rewrites it via code_interpreter (author="agent",
captured lazily the next time the file is served). Every state becomes a recoverable ``FileVersion`` snapshot, so the two
never silently clobber each other and any version can be restored.

The canonical working file (``object_key``) always mirrors the latest version;
snapshots are copies under a sibling ``users/{uid}/versions/...`` prefix.

Snapshots deliberately live *outside* the working tree rather than in a hidden
directory beside the file. They are system-managed data, not the user's files,
and keeping them in their own prefix makes that separation structural instead of
a naming convention every component has to remember:

* The code interpreter mounts only ``users/{uid}/sessions/{tid}``, so a snapshot
  is physically unreachable from a sandbox run — it cannot be read, clobbered,
  or re-reported as a generated output. Previously only a leading dot (which
  ``runtimes/_files.py`` happens to prune) kept that from happening.
* Object stores are not filesystems: SeaweedFS omits keys nested under a
  dot-directory from S3 ``LIST`` entirely, which silently excluded snapshots
  from per-user usage totals while they still consumed space.

    ``conversation_version_key``), never nested inside it: ``shared/`` is
    bind-mounted into the code-interpreter sandbox and enumerated as the
    user's files (``routes/workspace.py::list_files``), so a snapshot
    written under it would be sandbox-reachable and show up as a "file".

    The whole relative path below ``shared/`` is preserved as a directory
    under ``versions/``, holding one numbered file per snapshot — so the
    mapping is total and reversible by inspection. Keys that don't match
    the canonical conversation-workspace shape (e.g. a knowledge-base
    document) are left versioned next to themselves — there's no per-user
    prefix to hang the snapshot off.
