"""Citations — turn retrieval results into grounded, clickable source references.

A ``Citation`` is built *only* from metadata a backend actually returned for a
retrieved passage. Nothing here infers, guesses, or accepts a model-authored
source: if a result carries no ``filename`` it gets no citation index at all, so
the model has no number it could cite. That's what makes the resulting source
list trustworthy in the UI.

Numbering is owned by a ``CitationLedger`` rather than by each call, because the
chat prompt asks the model to issue several ``knowledge_search`` calls per turn.
If every call numbered its passages from 1, the model's ``[2]`` would mean a
different passage depending on which call it came from — plausible-looking but
wrong provenance. A ledger keyed on ``(file, page)`` hands the same passage the
same number for the life of a collection.
