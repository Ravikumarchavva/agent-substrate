        suspend via ``SuspendInterrupt``: the outer ``tool()`` wrapper's own

        (``SuspendInterrupt`` is a ``BaseException`` specifically so it
        bypasses the ``except Exception`` that would otherwise record it —
        see ``tool()``), so the entire tool body — including everything
        before the suspend point — re-executes on every resume. A plain

        the first attempt logs it and records a marker effect; every
        subsequent replay hits that marker and skips the append entirely.
