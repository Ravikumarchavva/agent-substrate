``spawn`` is idempotent against ``spawn_effects``, keyed by the caller's
replay-stable effect_id (derived from ``RunContext._alloc_path()`` — see the
kernel ``SupervisorProtocol.spawn()`` docstring for why it must never be computed
fresh). ``finish_run`` is the durable completion path: it marks the run
terminal in ``run_tree`` and fires a ``child:{run_id}`` signal to the
parent — that's what a suspended ``ctx.join``/``ctx.ask`` consumes to resume,
closing the "parent stalls the full timeout waiting on a crashed child" gap.
