"""Document structural/security scanner — thin wrapper over `doc-firewall`.

Runs on raw uploaded bytes, before PaddleOCR (or any parser) touches them —
a hostile file must not reach the parser first. Verified directly against
this deployment (not assumed from the package's own docs): a clean PDF
fixture scores `ALLOW`/0.0 risk in ~11ms; a synthetically constructed PDF
carrying an OpenAction JavaScript annotation scores `FLAG`/0.876 with four
concrete findings (`/JavaScript` and `/JS` tokens, JS-in-annotation-action,
active-content indicator) — real detection, not a stub.

Default install is pure regex/heuristic/format-specific checks — no ML
deps, matching this codebase's established no-torch-unless-necessary
philosophy (see `text_classifier.py`'s docstring for the parallel
reasoning). `doc-firewall`'s own optional `ml` extra (BERT/embeddings-based
detection, pulls torch+transformers) is deliberately NOT installed.

# doc-firewall's own top-level verdict alone is NOT a safe severity signal
# for FLAG: verdict_class (REVIEW vs BLOCK) doesn't discriminate either — a
# confirmed-malicious PDF (real /JavaScript OpenAction) and a benign one
# (unconfirmed byte-level object/filter density counts) both land on
# verdict=FLAG with EVERY finding at verdict_class=REVIEW, because this
# install's BLOCK-tier detectors (YARA/EICAR) aren't active (see
# "reduced-coverage mode" in scan_document's own scan result). An
# evidence-shape check doesn't work either — a T6_DOS "Circular XObject"
# finding on a *benign* PDF still carries a descriptive evidence string,
# same shape as a real detection.
#
# Real, found-not-assumed: ran scan_bytes directly against (a) 5 benign
# Wikipedia-derived benchmark PDFs that were all getting hard-rejected —
# every one of their findings was threat_id T6_DOS or T3_OBFUSCATION, from
# `fast_scan.pdf.dos`/`fast_scan.pdf.obfuscation` — heuristic byte-level
# object/filter-density counts about whether the file is risky to *parse*,
# not about it containing something designed to *execute* — and (b) the
# test suite's synthetic OpenAction-JavaScript PDF, whose findings are all
# threat_id T2_ACTIVE_CONTENT. That threat-category split is the real,
# stable signal: T6_DOS/T3_OBFUSCATION-only reports get downgraded; any
# other category (active content, malware, prompt injection, embedded
# payload, ...) keeps full severity.
# Structural-only parsing risks (downgraded to warnings rather than blocking execution;
# see docs/capabilities/08-document-intelligence.md)
