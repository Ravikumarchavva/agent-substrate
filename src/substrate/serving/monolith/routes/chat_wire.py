"""Chat wire-event helpers — image payloads for multimodal messages.

Split out of ``chat.py``. Inline persistence (``_WirePersister``,
``_build_tool_meta_map``) was removed: the agent itself durably logs its own
conversation straight to the EventLogProtocol (the single source of truth for
conversation history — see ``serving/stream/history.py::project_thread()``),
so no separate steps-table write is needed here anymore.
