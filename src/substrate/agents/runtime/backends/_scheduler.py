"""InMemoryScheduler — Stage 0 single-process asyncio work-queue.

Coalescing guarantee: enqueuing a run_id that is already pending is a no-op
(the Wakeup is merged into the existing entry).  Workers receive each run at
most once per wake-cycle regardless of how many sources enqueued it.

In Stage 0 runs are in-process asyncio Tasks, so the SchedulerProtocol primarily
acts as a ready-queue and state-tracker.  Stage 1 replaces this with
Postgres SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.
