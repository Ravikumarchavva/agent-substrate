"""Input-safety contracts: what a text/image classifier returns, and the
Protocol shape agents-layer guardrails depend on.

Lives in kernel (not agents/capabilities) because both a TURN-stage
middleware (agents, L1) and its concrete model-backed implementation
(capabilities, L2) need the exact same shape — the classic reason kernel
holds a Protocol: multiple layers need it, and it has zero I/O/deps of its
own. The middleware never imports a concrete classifier; it only ever sees
these two Protocols, injected from ``infrastructure/serving_factory.py``.

Deliberately NOT here: any actual model, tokenizer, or inference code — all
of that lives in ``capabilities/safety/``.
