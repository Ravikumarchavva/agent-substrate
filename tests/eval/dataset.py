"""Starter labeled retrieval set for the eval harness.

The RAG plan calls for ~200-500 hand-labeled queries against real ingested
documents. This is deliberately **not** that — building a set that size
means curating real documents and having a human label relevant chunks
per query, which is a data-curation task, not something to fabricate here.
What this is: ~20 hand-built queries against a small set of synthetic
"documents" (each already split into its final chunk form, with an id),
covering both categories the plan calls out (§Evaluation harness, point 9)
— text→text and text→image (via a chart/table's caption, since that's what
a lexical/rerank pass actually sees for a visual candidate — see
``backends/local.py::query()``'s docstring on why). Enough to exercise every
metric correctly end-to-end and catch a gross regression; not enough to
trust a specific score. See ``test_retrieval_eval.py``'s module docstring
for how to grow this toward the plan's real target size.
