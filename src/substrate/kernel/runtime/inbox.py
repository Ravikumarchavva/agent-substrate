"""InboxProtocol — durable per-agent mailbox.

The InboxProtocol is the delivery half of the social fabric.  Delivering a message to
a dormant agent is what *wakes* it — the InboxProtocol notifies the SchedulerProtocol which
enqueues a wakeup for the agent's run.

Robustness guarantees (all implementations must honour)
--------------------------------------------------------
1. **Exactly-once delivery tracking (dedup by Message.id).**
   ``deliver`` is idempotent: re-delivering the same ``Message.id`` is a
   no-op.  At-least-once transports (Redis Streams, NATS) re-deliver on
   subscriber restart; the InboxProtocol absorbs the duplicates so the agent never
   processes the same message twice.

2. **Per-sender FIFO ordering.**
   Messages from the same sender (keyed by ``Message.sender``) are drained
   in arrival order.  Messages from different senders may interleave.
   This prevents "post deleted" arriving before "post created" when both
   come from the same producer.

3. **Retry + dead-letter after N failures.**
   ``nack()`` increments the delivery attempt counter for a message.  When
   the counter reaches the implementation's ``max_retries`` ceiling, the
   message is moved to dead-letter storage and removed from the live inbox.
   The dead-letter queue is queryable via ``dead_letters()``.

Caller flow
-----------
Worker drains inbox → processes each message → on success ``ack(msg_id)`` →
on failure ``nack(msg_id, error=...)`` → SchedulerProtocol re-enqueues wakeup.
