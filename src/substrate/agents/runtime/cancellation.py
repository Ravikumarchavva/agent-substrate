"""CancellationToken — concrete cooperative-cancellation primitive.

Split out of ``kernel/agent/runtime_context.py``: this has real asyncio
state (an ``Event``, a callback list) and real behavior, so it's a concrete
implementation, not a contract — kernel keeps only the
``CancellationToken`` Protocol (see that module), typed against this class.

Usage::

    token = CancellationToken()

    # From outside (orchestrator, timeout handler, user):
    token.cancel()

    # Inside any coroutine:
    token.check()         # raises CancellationError if cancelled
    await token.wait()    # blocks until cancelled

    # Register a callback (called synchronously on cancel):
    token.add_callback(lambda: ...)
