"""SchedulerProtocol retry semantics: re-execution, backoff, and classification.

Covers the fix for a real bug: a journaled error effect used to be
rehydrated by EffectCache.fold() and re-raised from cache on every replay,
so a scheduler retry never actually re-executed the failed operation — it
just replayed the same cached failure until max_retries was exhausted.

1. A retryable (unclassified) failure genuinely re-executes on retry.
2. A PermanentError skips the retry policy and fails on the first attempt.
3. Backoff delay is honored (uses a tiny backoff_s to stay fast).
4. EffectCache.fold() excludes error effects from the rehydrated cache.
