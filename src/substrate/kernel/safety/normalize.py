"""Text de-obfuscation for the safety pipeline — runs before every text
classifier call, chat and document alike.

Non-ML, deterministic, pure-stdlib-plus-one-tiny-package (``confusable_homoglyphs``,
zero transitive deps). This is deliberately NOT folded into NFKC: NFKC only
folds *compatibility* forms (fullwidth, ligatures, ⓐ-style circled letters)
— it does **not** map Cyrillic 'і' (U+0456) to Latin 'i'. Those are two
different Unicode mechanisms solving two different problems; treating NFKC
as a homoglyph defense is a real, common mistake this module exists to not
make (see ``docs`` / the plan this was built from).

The actual homoglyph defense is the UTS-39 "confusables" table (via
``confusable_homoglyphs``): for each character, ask what it's confusable
with in the LATIN block, and if it's not itself Latin/Common, substitute the
Latin form to build a "skeleton" string. A classifier scores the skeleton;
the caller decides whether to also score the original.
