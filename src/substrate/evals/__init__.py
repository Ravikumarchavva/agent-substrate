"""Evaluation framework for measuring agent quality.

Provides:
  - EvalCase / EvalDataset  — define what to test
  - LLMJudge                — grade outputs using an LLM
  - EvalRunner              — execute eval suites
  - EvalResult / EvalReport — structured results with metrics
  - Built-in criteria       — correctness, helpfulness, safety, relevance

Quick start::

    from substrate.evals import (
        EvalCase, EvalDataset, LLMJudge, EvalRunner, CORRECTNESS,
    )

    dataset = EvalDataset(cases=[
        EvalCase(
            input="What is 2+2?",
            expected_output="4",
            tags=["math"],
        ),
    ])

    judge = LLMJudge(model_client=my_openai_client, criteria=[CORRECTNESS])
    runner = EvalRunner(agent=my_agent, judge=judge)
    report = await runner.run(dataset)
    print(report.summary())
