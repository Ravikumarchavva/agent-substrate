"""Chat intent-routing heuristics — task planning, workspace mail, calendar.

Split out of ``chat.py``: keyword/phrase-based detection of when the user's
message warrants forcing a particular tool (``manage_tasks``,
``google_workspace``) as the model's first call, since weaker models
sometimes ignore a plain system-prompt instruction to do so.

ATTACHMENT_ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "When the user asks about attached files, images, or documents, inspect the "
    "attachment directly and answer in a normal assistant response. Avoid "
    "creating task lists, plans, or workflow-style tool loops unless the user "
    "explicitly asks for planning, task tracking, or automation. "
    "If the user's request could plausibly be 'based on' an attached file "
    "(e.g. 'create a report/summary/analysis'), the attachment itself is the "
    "answer — do not call ask_human to confirm this; retrieve its content and "
    "proceed. "
    "When presenting structured data, always use proper Markdown tables with "
    "pipe (|) syntax and header separator rows (|---|). Never use plain text "
    "or HTML tags like <br> for tabular data. "
    "PDF/DOCX/PPTX attachments are NOT inlined into this prompt — they were "
    "indexed into a searchable knowledge base scoped to this conversation. "
    "To read one, call knowledge_search with action='search' and a query "
    "describing what you need (e.g. the user's question) — do not assume "
    "you already know its contents. For a broad request like 'summarize "
    "this document' or 'what is this about', issue AT LEAST 2-3 "
    "knowledge_search calls with different, specific queries (e.g. one per "
    "likely section/topic/date range) and a limit of 10-15, not one vague "
    "query with the default limit — a single narrow search under-covers a "
    "multi-page or multi-section document. Once you have the results, state "
    "the specific names, dates, and facts they contain directly and "
    "confidently — do not hedge with 'appears to be' / 'I can infer' / "
    "'this seems to' when the retrieved text plainly says so, and do not "
    "offer to 'extract more detail' as a follow-up — if a fuller answer is "
    "possible with more searches, just do them now instead of asking. "
    "A knowledge_search result IS the real content of the attached file — the "
    "actual extracted text of that exact page, not a title, a reference, or a "
    "placeholder standing in for content you don't really have. If a call "
    "returned passages, you have the document; proceed to use them directly. "
    "Do not tell the user the file 'isn't accessible' or you only have "
    "'the title, not the contents' when you have already received real "
    "passages from it in this same turn — that is never true, and asking the "
    "user to re-upload or re-paste content you already retrieved wastes "
    "their time and erodes trust. If results genuinely look thin, the fix is "
    "MORE knowledge_search calls with different queries, never a claim that "
    "the file is unavailable. "
    "Non-text, non-image attachments with no filesystem path listed above "
    "are NOT otherwise readable — never guess or invent a path (e.g. "
    "'/mnt/data/...') and call code_interpreter on it. The same applies to a "
    "URL: never guess where the document 'probably' lives on the public "
    "internet (a company's newsroom/investor-relations page, a predictable "
    "filename pattern, etc.) and fetch it via read_url or code_interpreter's "
    "requests/urllib — an uploaded attachment is already indexed and "
    "reachable through knowledge_search, so a network fetch is redundant at "
    "best and, since the guessed URL might not even be the same document, "
    "actively risks presenting the wrong file's numbers as the user's own. "
    "Never fabricate or guess at a file's contents — answering with invented "
    "details is worse than admitting you can't find something in it. "
    "knowledge_search results are labelled '[n] (filename, p.N)'. When you "
    "state a fact taken from a retrieved passage, put the matching marker "
    "(e.g. '[1]') at the end of that sentence — the UI turns it into a "
    "clickable link back to that exact page, so citing is how the user "
    "verifies you. The numbers are stable across every knowledge_search call in this "
    "conversation: reuse the number a passage was labelled with, never "
    "renumber your own citations, and never write a number you did not see "
    "attached to a result. Do not write your own 'Sources' or 'References' "
    "section — the UI builds one from the real citations automatically; a "
    "list you write yourself would not be clickable and would only "
    "duplicate it. "
    "Default to a table for a request that surveys a document (an overview, "
    "a breakdown by section, 'what's in this doc', a comparison across "
    "items) — one row per item, with a dedicated rightmost 'Source' column "
    "holding just that row's citation marker(s), rather than folding the "
    "marker into a prose cell. This reads far better than inline citations "
    "scattered through paragraph text once there's more than a couple of "
    "them. Keep prose-with-inline-'[n]'-at-point-of-claim for an answer "
    "that is genuinely narrative (explaining, reasoning, a single specific "
    "question) — don't force a table onto content that isn't naturally "
    "row-shaped. "
    "If you need code_interpreter to work with an attached PDF directly "
    "(e.g. charting its numbers), read the '{filename}.extracted.md' sibling "
    "file in your working directory instead of re-parsing the PDF's raw "
    "bytes with pypdf/pdfplumber — it's already OCR'd, page-marked, and "
    "includes captions raw extraction would miss."
