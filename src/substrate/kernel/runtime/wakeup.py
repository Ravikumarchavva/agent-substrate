"""Wakeup and SignalBusProtocol — what resumes a dormant run.

A run in SUSPENDED state costs zero RAM and zero CPU.  It wakes when one of
four things happens:

    ``message``    — a message was delivered to its InboxProtocol
    ``timer``      — a wall-clock deadline has passed (ctx.sleep_until)
    ``signal``     — a named event was fired on the SignalBusProtocol
    ``child_done`` — a spawned subagent reached a terminal state

Wakeup is a sealed value object carried by the SchedulerProtocol from the event that
triggers it to the release call that records the next sleep.  It is also the
payload of the ``run.suspended`` log entry so the cause of every suspension
is replayable.

Multiple wakeup sources coalescing
-----------------------------------
If a timer fires AND a message arrives while the run is suspended, the
SchedulerProtocol coalesces them into a single wakeup and enqueues the run once —
never twice.  The order of the combined triggers is unspecified; the agent
drains its InboxProtocol and checks timers/signals during the same wake-cycle.
Implementations must honour this coalescing guarantee.

    Signals are lightweight — they carry a small JSON payload and wake a

    Implementations: in-memory asyncio dict (Stage 0), Postgres table +

    Semantic guarantees
    -------------------
    - A signal fired before the run suspends is not lost — it is buffered as
      an unconsumed row/entry and delivered the next time something consumes
      that name for that run.
    - ``consume`` is exactly-once per ``effect_id``: the caller supplies a
      deterministic, replay-stable ``effect_id`` (see
      ``RunContext``/``Effect.make_id``); a wait that replays after already
      having consumed a signal gets the SAME payload back (idempotent
      re-claim), never a different or absent one.
    - ``timer`` is best-effort with millisecond granularity; the implementation
      may fire up to a few seconds late under load.  Agents must not rely on
      precise wall-clock accuracy for correctness.
