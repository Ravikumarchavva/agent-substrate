"""EffectCache — per-run effect-result cache, built by folding the EventLogProtocol.

This is the "fold" half of the kernel's fold-is-truth doctrine
(``kernel/runtime/log_entry.py``): reconstructing a run's effect-dedup state
from its append-only log instead of a separate, independently-TTL'd store.

It replaces the Journal as ``RunContext``'s source of truth for at-most-once
effect execution. Effect results are ``effect.result`` EventLogProtocol entries — the
same durable, optimistically-concurrent, cross-process-safe store that
already backs run history — so there is no longer a Redis journal whose TTL
can silently expire mid-run and break the at-most-once guarantee (a run
suspended or orphaned longer than the TTL used to come back to a journal
miss on every effect: LLM calls re-billed, tools re-executed).

Built once per lease (``Worker._run_agent``), read many times during that
run — lookups are a plain dict access, no I/O.

Error effects are deliberately excluded from the fold (see ``fold()``): a
scheduler retry must re-execute a failed effect, not replay its failure
forever from cache. They're still written to the EventLogProtocol by
``RunContext._record_effect`` for the durable per-attempt record — this only
affects what a *fresh* fold (a new lease, i.e. every retry) rehydrates.
