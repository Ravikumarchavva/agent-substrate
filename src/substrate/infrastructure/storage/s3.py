aiobotocore, so it works unchanged against SeaweedFS (this stack's default
self-hosted backend — see deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml), real AWS
S3, or any other S3-compatible service (Garage, R2, ...)."""

    ----------
    endpoint_url
        S3-compatible endpoint (e.g. ``http://localhost:9000``). Leave empty
        (the default) to talk to real AWS S3 — boto3 resolves the regional
        endpoint itself from ``region``, but only when it receives ``None``,
        not an empty string, hence the ``or None`` below.
    access_key / secret_key
        Credentials. Leave both empty (the default) to fall back to boto3's
        standard credential chain (env vars, ``~/.aws/credentials``, an IAM
        role) — again requires ``None``, not ``""``, to actually trigger that
        fallback.
    default_bucket
        Bucket to use when not specified per-call.
