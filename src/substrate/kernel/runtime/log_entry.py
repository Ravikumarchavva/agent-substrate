"""RunLogEntry and EventLogProtocol — the append-only durable spine of every run.

Named ``RunLogEntry`` (not ``RunEvent``) to avoid collision with
``kernel/events.py::Event`` (the generic pub/sub envelope — a different thing).

Truth model
-----------
A run's state is ``fold(entries from seq=0)`` — implemented by
``agents/runtime/effect_cache.py::EffectCache.fold()``, folded once per lease.
There is no separate checkpoint/snapshot type; nothing in this codebase
implements one today. If fold cost ever exceeds budget at P99, a log-
compaction snapshot would be the fix — evaluate then, not preemptively.

Optimistic concurrency
----------------------
``append()`` takes ``expected_seq`` — the caller's view of the current last
sequence number.  If the store's actual last_seq differs, it raises
``ConcurrentAppendError``.  This fences two workers from writing to the same
run simultaneously without a distributed lock.

Standard ``kind`` values
------------------------
``run.started``     — run opened; payload carries boot Message
``msg.received``    — message delivered to inbox and drained
``tool.called``     — tool invocation; payload carries Effect.id + spec
``tool.result``     — tool result journaled; payload carries EffectResult
``child.spawned``   — subagent spawned; payload carries child RunId + Actor
``child.completed`` — child reached terminal state; payload carries RunResult ref
``run.suspended``   — run going dormant; payload carries Wakeup
``run.completed``   — terminal success; payload carries output
``run.failed``      — terminal failure; payload carries error message
``run.cancelled``   — terminal cancellation; payload carries reason + orphans_resolved
``orphans.resolved``— child disposition on permanent parent failure

    - Entries within a run are ordered by ``seq`` and never reordered.
    - ``append`` is atomic and serialised per run_id — no two appends to the
      same run succeed concurrently (optimistic-concurrency fencing via
      ``expected_seq``).
    - ``read`` is consistent: a reader sees entries in ``seq`` order with no gaps.
    - ``tail`` is a live view: after exhausting existing entries it waits for
      new ones indefinitely (until the caller cancels the iteration).
