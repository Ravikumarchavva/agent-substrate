"""Runtime — durable runtime over injectable kernel-Protocol backends.

The Runtime is backend-agnostic: every backend is injected and defaults to its
in-process implementation.  It never imports a concrete durable backend, so the
``agents`` layer stays strictly above ``infrastructure``.

Usage (in-memory, Stage 0 — default)::

    async with Runtime() as rt:
        await rt.register(my_agent)
        run_id = await rt.submit(my_agent.id, boot_msg)

Usage (Postgres + Redis, Stage 1) — use the infrastructure-layer factory, which
constructs the durable backends and injects them::

    from substrate.infrastructure.runtime import build_postgres_runtime

    async with build_postgres_runtime(
        postgres_url="postgresql://...",
        redis_url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    ) as rt:
        ...

All backends implement the same kernel Protocols, so agent code never
needs to know which backend is active.
