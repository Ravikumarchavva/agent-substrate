"""Multi-step research and synthesis workflow.

Demonstrates chaining multiple agent.run() calls where the output of one
step becomes the input context for the next.  This mimics a real-world
research pipeline:

    Step 1 — Search: gather raw information on the topic
    Step 2 — Analyze: identify key themes and claims
    Step 3 — Synthesize: combine findings into a coherent narrative
    Step 4 — Format: produce a structured research summary

Run:
    cd agent-substrate
